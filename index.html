		   This course focuses on techniques of designing for the web. We will utilize problem solving as a way of creating design and content that serves in both form and function in order to develop web based projects. Students will have readings and discussions as well as learn practical knowledge about how digital design functions. We will look at topics concerning the history of coding and the internet, futurism, storytelling and related contemporary digital theory. In practical terms the course will teach students how to create digital content either as audio or image based media. The student will also understand user journeys and basic UX, basic brand anatomy, social media campaigns and responsive typography for the web. The final project will be to use Figma to design a website and implement that website with a CMS as portfolio showcasing their work.

		  Readings
		  </h1>
		Each week there will be readings that will expand on the ideas discussed in the course. The readings are design writings taken from many vantage points and from varying moments of design and art history. These readings will broaden your scope and allow you to be open minded about concepts that you may be able to utilize in your own work. We will have a brief discussion as a class each week about what we have read.
		<br><br>
		  
		<h1>
		  Presentations
		  </h1>
		Each week one student will be selected to give a brief presentation of a digital project that they have found that inspires them and to expose the class to something new. This digital project will showcase good design on the web and the student should be able to explain why this example represents good design in terms of functionality or visual interest. There will be a google slides template that you can use to fill in the information for your presentation. The student that is chosen that week will be at random and after you have presented once you should continue to create a new presentation of something that you’ve found to share with the class when you are called upon again to present. 
		
		  <br><br>
		<h1>
		 Are.na sketchbook 
		  </h1>
		In order to keep your ideas organized we will utilize the website Are.na. This will be a sort of ‘digital sketchbook’ for what you come across in your research. As part of your grade you will be expected to have an Are.na channel with at least 20 blocks of inspiration / images / digital content that you’ve been gathering for the course and your projects, there is a chrome extension that might come in handy. You can also take notes directly in Are.na if you like. At the end of the course there will be an option to print a PDF or a book of your findings
		
		  <br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Inclusive Learning Statement
		  </h1>
		
		Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I encourage you to visit the Academic Development & Support Center to determine how you could improve your learning as well. If you need official accommodations, you have a right to have these met. 
		
		  <br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Attendance Policy
		  </h1>
		
		For virtual meetings, class attendance is mandatory. Circumstances beyond your control will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is your responsibility to catch up with class announcements, assignments, and materials on Blackboard. You may not receive credit for a course in which you fail to be present 80% of the time, as determined by the Attendance records. Students should not disrupt class by conducting any activities that interrupt.
		
		
		<br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Course Usage of Blackboard Learn
		  </h1>
		
		Copies of the course syllabus and major assignments may be found on Blackboard Learn.  You are responsible for regularly checking the online resources, which is accessed through the Georgian Court Blackboard Site.  Additional support is found on the GCU Blackboard landing page.
